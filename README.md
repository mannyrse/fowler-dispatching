# Fowler Dispatching (Demo Site)

This project is a **design prototype** created as a personal exercise in working with **Bootstrap**.  
It builds on a mockup originally made as part of my **Web Design 201 - Interaction Design** final project at UWSP.  

## Project Purpose
The original mockup was redesigned and translated into Bootstrap as a way to:
- Practice responsive design techniques.  
- Experiment with Bootstrapâ€™s grid system, components, and utilities.  
- Refine the overall visual layout for a more professional and approachable look.  

## Notes
- Fowler Dispatching was a small dispatching business run by a friend in Racine, WI, but is **no longer active**.  
- This site is strictly a **demo project** and not affiliated with any real business operations.  

## Tech Used
- **Bootstrap 5**
- HTML5 / CSS3
